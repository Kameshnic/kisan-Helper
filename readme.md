Project Title: Kisan Helper a Middle Man App
Project Overview:
The Kisan Farmer Middle Man App aims to directly connect farmers with consumers, bypassing intermediaries and ensuring fair pricing for agricultural products. The app leverages modern web technologies to create a seamless experience for both farmers and consumers, allowing farmers to list their products, and consumers to browse, communicate, and make purchases directly.

Key Features:
Farmer Registration & Product Listing: Farmers can register and list their agricultural products (fruits, vegetables, grains) along with descriptions, prices, and available quantities.
Consumer Interaction: Consumers can browse the listed products, check real-time pricing, and place orders. They can also view detailed product descriptions and communicate with the farmers directly via an in-app messaging system.
Price Prediction (Machine Learning): The app uses machine learning to predict future prices based on historical data and market trends. This helps both farmers and consumers make informed decisions.
Order Management: The app integrates payment systems and manages the logistics for product deliveries, ensuring smooth transactions from purchase to delivery.
Admin Panel: Admins can manage both farmer and consumer profiles, oversee orders, and maintain the overall health of the platform.
Technologies Used:
Front-End: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material UI
Back-End: Node.js, Express.js (for API integration and server-side logic)
Database: MongoDB (for storing user profiles, product listings, and transactions)
Machine Learning: Python (for implementing price prediction algorithms using historical data)
Version Control: Git, GitHub (for project management and version control)
Hosting: Vercel (for front-end deployment), Heroku (for back-end deployment)

App Features Walkthrough:
Farmer’s Dashboard: A dashboard for farmers to add new products, update product information, and track orders.
Consumer’s Dashboard: A section for consumers to browse products, place orders, and check the predicted pricing trends.
Admin Panel: A section for administrators to manage farmers, consumers, and oversee product listings and orders.
Machine Learning Predictions: Machine learning models are used to predict the prices of agricultural products based on past data. These predictions are displayed on the dashboard for consumers and farmers.
Machine Learning Integration:
For the price prediction feature, the app utilizes historical market data (such as seasonal pricing trends) to predict the future pricing of agricultural products. I’ve used Python and basic machine learning models like Linear Regression to predict prices based on historical data.

Steps for Implementing Price Prediction:

Data Collection: Gathered historical market pricing data for different products.
Data Cleaning: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and normalize the data.
Model Training: Implemented machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Decision Trees to forecast prices.
API Integration: Integrated the machine learning model into the back-end using an API to provide price predictions in real-time.
Figma Design:
The design for the app is created in Figma, providing an interactive and intuitive user interface for both farmers and consumers. The design includes all necessary pages, such as the farmer’s dashboard, consumer product browsing, admin panel, and more.

Future Enhancements:
Mobile App: Extend this platform to a mobile app (iOS and Android) to reach a wider audience.
Advanced Machine Learning Models: Implement more advanced models for better price predictions and forecasting.
SMS/Push Notifications: Add functionality for notifications about price changes, new product listings, or order updates.
Experience and Challenges:
During the development of this app, I encountered several challenges:

Real-Time Data Updates: Integrating live data feeds to update prices and market trends dynamically was complex. I overcame this by collaborating with the back-end team to ensure efficient API calls.
Machine Learning Integration: The most challenging aspect was integrating the machine learning models into a real-time application. I worked closely with the data science team to build and deploy a simple but effective prediction model that could be used in production.
UI/UX Design: Designing an easy-to-navigate interface that served both farmers (who may not be tech-savvy) and consumers required constant iteration based on feedback.
