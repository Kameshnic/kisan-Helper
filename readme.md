# Kisan Farmer Middle Man App

## Project Title: Kisan Helper – A Middle Man App for Farmers and Consumers

### Project Overview:
The Kisan Farmer Middle Man App is designed to create a direct connection between farmers and consumers, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair pricing for agricultural products. The app offers features for farmers to list their products, consumers to browse and purchase them, and machine learning to predict market trends.

### Key Features:
- **Farmer Registration & Product Listing**: Farmers can register and list agricultural products like fruits, vegetables, and grains with descriptions, prices, and available quantities.
- **Consumer Interaction**: Consumers can browse products, check real-time pricing, place orders, and communicate with farmers via an in-app messaging system.
- **Price Prediction (Machine Learning)**: The app leverages machine learning to predict future product prices based on historical data and market trends.
- **Order Management**: Integrates payment systems and handles logistics for product deliveries, ensuring smooth transactions.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage profiles, oversee orders, and ensure the health of the platform.

### Technologies Used:
- **Front-End**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material UI
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express.js (API integration and server-side logic)
- **Database**: MongoDB (storing user profiles, product listings, transactions)
- **Machine Learning**: Python (implementing price prediction algorithms)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub (project management)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (front-end deployment), Heroku (back-end deployment)

### Installation Instructions:

#### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kisan-farmer-app.git
```

#### Install dependencies:
Navigate to both the front-end and back-end directories and run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

#### Run the application locally:

- **For the front-end**:
```bash
npm start
```

- **For the back-end**:
```bash
node server.js
```

#### Access the app:
Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### App Features Walkthrough:
- **Farmer’s Dashboard**: A space for farmers to add products, update listings, and track orders.
- **Consumer’s Dashboard**: A section for consumers to browse products, place orders, and check predicted prices.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage farmers, consumers, oversee orders, and handle product listings.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Price predictions are shown based on historical data and trends.

---

### Machine Learning Integration:
- **Price Prediction**: 
    - **Data Collection**: Gathered historical pricing data for agricultural products.
    - **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data for missing values.
    - **Model Training**: Implemented Linear Regression and Decision Trees to forecast prices.
    - **API Integration**: Integrated the machine learning model into the back-end for real-time price predictions.
